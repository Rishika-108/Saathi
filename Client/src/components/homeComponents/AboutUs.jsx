          Saathi is a self-reflection and productivity platform that helps you
          become more self-aware. By analyzing your journaling patterns and
          productivity data, the system detects cognitive biases and emotional
          triggers, turning insights into a gamified self-improvement journey.

          Our goal is to encourage consistent journaling, offer meaningful
          insights, and motivate you to track your progress â€” making personal
          growth both engaging and rewarding.
